# Scientific Calculator in C++

## Description
This project is a fully functional scientific calculator built in C++. It supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as more advanced functions such as trigonometry, logarithms, exponentiation, and square roots.

## Features
- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Advanced functions: trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), logarithms, square roots, exponentiation
- User-friendly interface
- Error handling for invalid inputs

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scientific-calculator.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder:  
   `cd scientific-calculator`
3. Compile the code using a C++ compiler:  
   `g++ calculator.cpp -o calculator`
4. Run the program:  
   `./calculator`

## Future Improvements
- Add support for matrix operations
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI)
